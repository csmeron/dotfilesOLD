# CSM WSL Setup Guide

_csmeron basic WSL environment setup_

This file is the "guide" for how I set up my WSL environment. I mostly use my
WSL env for programming/development as well as things I'd prefer to use Linux
for, because Windows is ugly, disgusting, and abhorrent.

---

This will cover how I set up things including but not limited to:

- Setting up my [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) config using my [dotfiles](/.config/nvim/),
- Setting [ZSH](https://www.zsh.org) as default shell, possibly mentioning my preferred aliases
- Implementing [Oh-My-ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh) for plugins like autocomplete and syntax highlighting,
- Installing [Starship](https://starship.rs/) and applying my preferred [prompt](/.config/starship.toml),
- and maybe more!

## Initial Information
