# csmeron .dotfiles !!

This repo is literally just the most basic form of my dotfiles for Linux machines, nothing crazy.

It's mostly set up to keep my Neovim config and Starship prompt from being lost in the event of a 
machine issue.

## Neovim config
My nvim config is a semi-custom rewrite of (NvChad)[https://nvchad.com/].
I did this mostly because I wanted to have everything in one place, rather than relying on their repo, just in case.

Things like the NvChad/ui and base46 are entirely theirs, while I've replaced things like the Mason and LSP configs with my own entirely.

Again, they're nothing special, hence the private repo, but I wanted to have everything in one place.

## zshrc and starshop.toml
Literally just my shell and propmt configs, nothing insane, nothing worth mention.
