# csmeron .dotfiles

This repo is literally just the most basic form of my dotfiles for Linux
machines, nothing crazy.

It's mostly set up to keep my Neovim and WSL config alongside my Starship
prompt from being lost in the event of a machine issue.

For into on WSL, see [The setup guide](setup/wsl.md). It contains the general,
basic setup of my WSL environment as I prefer to use it, though doesn't
mention anything beyond basic setup.

## Neovim config

My nvim config is a semi-custom rewrite of [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/).
I did this mostly because I wanted to have everything in one place, rather than
relying on their repo, just in case.

Things like the NvChad/ui and base46 are entirely theirs, while I've replaced
things like the Mason and LSP configs with my own entirely.

Again, they're nothing special, hence the private repo, but I wanted to have
everything in one place.

## .zshrc and starship.toml

Literally just my shell and propmt configs, nothing insane, nothing worth
mention.
